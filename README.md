# Understanding-Body-Composition-and-Demographics-in-NHANES

This project aims to visualize the demographic variables of NHANES data from 2011-2018. 

Data is available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm
The datasets to be downloaded:
1. Demographic Variables & Sample Weights
2. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry - Whole Body
3. Body Measures

This visualization requires phenotypes defined by Prado et al. (2014) and it should be recreated based on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry - Whole Body data.
